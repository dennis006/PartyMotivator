    EVENT EXPLANATIONS:
    
    CHALLENGE_MODE_COMPLETED: Fired when a Mythic+ run is completed
    (older game versions). Here we send the corresponding completion message.
    
    CHALLENGE_MODE_COMPLETED_REWARDS: Fired when the loot chest appears at the end
    of a Mythic+ run (since patch 11.2). This is the preferred event
    for the completion message, as it is guaranteed to fire when the run
    is actually completed.
    
    PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD: Fired when the player enters the world
    or a new zone/instance. Here we reset the endPosted flag,
    so that a message can be sent again for each new run.
    
    CHALLENGE_MODE_START: Fired when a new Mythic+ run starts.
    Here we reset the endPosted flag to ensure that the
    completion message can be sent for the new run.
    
    FUNCTIONALITY:
    - The addon monitors both Challenge Mode events (COMPLETED and COMPLETED_REWARDS)
    - It uses C_ChallengeMode.GetChallengeCompletionInfo() to check:
      * info.onTime: Boolean, whether the run was on time
      * info.keystoneUpgradeLevels: Number of keystone level upgrades
    - Depending on the result, an appropriate message is sent:
      * "GG! We timed it and upgraded the key ðŸŽ‰" - for successful run with upgrade
      * "Thanks for the key! We'll get it next time." - for untimely run
    - The endPosted flag prevents double posts, even if both events fire
    - The flag is reset on instance change and run start
